Created a basic node application. 
npm i express
npm i nodemon -D // the D meaning we want it as a dev dependency

configured nodemon in package.json to run in the format nodemon src/

Converting the node project started in vanilla javascript to typescript.

npm i typescript ts-node -D 

typescript will convert our core ts code to core js code. ts-node is a utility
library that will help us run typescript program directly from the terminal 

Next we create a tsconfig.json file

To make express and node libraries make use of typescript, we install the following packages as dev dependencies.

npm i -D @types/node @types/express

We need to start changing any js file extension to ts and tell nodemon in package.json we will be running ts file 
instaed of js. We do this by changing this line of code "start": "nodemon src/index.ts"

Because the browser does not understand typescript we need to convert it to javascript. We do this by 
adding the build command in the package.json file.
"build": "tsc -p ./"

We need to add eslint extention to make our code more stable.

we run the command 

npm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

eslint for more stable code. typescript eslint-parser helps us parse typescript with linting
typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is a plugin that helps typescript eslint do it's job efficiently

npm i -D @types/body-parser
